    <p>
        I'm a Computer Science professional with a unique journey. Originally from Cuba, I moved to the U.S. and juggled various jobs while studying at night, learning resilience and adaptability. Before attending Boston University, I worked in underwriting and credit analysis, developing skills in risk assessment and data analysis. This experience, combined with my Computer Science degree, has equipped me to tackle challenges in tech, whether in development, data analysis, or both. I'm ready to bring my diverse background to innovative projects and teams. Let's connect and see how my journey can add value.
